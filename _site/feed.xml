				<title>Proposed Notary Node architecture by Dragon Riders team</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Komodo elections are in progress and probably every holder is reading Notary Node candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/vote2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt;. Many proposals offer some kind of revenue share which they handout when they get enough votes and win. We at DragonRiders team would like to offer something different to the Komodo community. We are two IT professionals – &lt;a href=&quot;https://patchkez.github.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;patchkez&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Emmanux&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emmanux&lt;/a&gt;  – who want to invest in Komodo Platform by solving every existing scaling issue and adopting innovative technologies and practices from DevOps culture. We already have a concept of how the future architecture of Notary nodes might look like. Here we try to share a few words about current Notary Nodes architecture, possible future bottlenecks and how to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
